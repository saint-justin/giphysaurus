# Justin Vaughn, Marvel FED Challenge 2020
Justin Vaughn's entry for the Marvel Front-End Developer Challenge 2020. Still very much a work in progress, repo will be added to more and more as the project progresses.

## Tech Stack
`React JS`, `SASS` as a CSS Precompiler, and Figma for initial design work. The majority of components are functional with made with hooks for code simplicity. 

## Initial Design
The initial design was done in Figma. Since starting development, the two designs have diverged but for any who want to see the original plan, open [the link here](https://www.figma.com/file/e2e4DHAFIPeIdRdD2yXnjV/Marvel-FED-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1).
