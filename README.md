# Justin Vaughn, Marvel FED Challenge 2020
Justin Vaughn's entry for the Marvel Front-End Developer Challenge 2020. Still very much a work in progress, repo will be added to more and more as the project progresses.

## Tech Stack
`React JS`, `SASS` as a CSS Precompiler, and Figma for initial design work. The majority of components are functional with made with hooks for code simplicity. 

## Demo Instructions
To run this project locally, please follow the coming set of steps:
1. Download the repo in it's totality with the green "Clone or Download" button above.
2. Create a folder on your computer and unzip the download into said folder (inside the folder you created, there should just be one folder named "marvel-fed-challenge-2020-master"
3. Open into the folder named "marvel-fed-challenge-2020-master", open the folder inside that one named "marvel-challenge", and open your IDE of choise in that folder (I'd reccomend opening the project in VS Code, and running the terminal in the "marvel-challenge" folder in there).
4. Install [NPM or Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) and run the command `npm install` in the terminal to install all dependencies. 
5. Open the `src` folder, then the folder named `hidden`, and inside of it open the new file named `api-key.js` 
6. Sign up on [developers.giphy.com](https://developers.giphy.com/) and generate an API key, the replace `API_KEY_HERE` with the key that you generated on the site. Save and close `api-key.js`.
7. Back in terminal in the `marvel-challenge` folder, run the command `npm start` and enjoy!



## Initial Design
The initial design was done in Figma. Since starting development, the two designs have diverged but for any who want to see the original plan, open [the link here](https://www.figma.com/file/e2e4DHAFIPeIdRdD2yXnjV/Marvel-FED-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1).
