# Justin Vaughn, Marvel FED Challenge 2020
Justin Vaughn's entry for the Marvel Front-End Developer Challenge 2020. Still very much a work in progress, repo will be added to more and more as the project progresses.

## Tech Stack
`React JS`, `SASS` as a CSS Precompiler, and Figma for initial design work. The majority of components are functional with made with hooks for code simplicity. 

## Demo Instructions
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1. Download the repo in it's totality with the green "Clone or Download" button above.
2. Create a folder on your computer and unzip the download into said folder. Inside the folder you just unzipped the project to, there should only be a single folder named `marvel-fed-challenge-2020-master`.
4. Make sure you have [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Navigate to the `marvel-challenge` folder in a terminal of your choice and run the command `npm install` to install the neccesary dependencies. 
5. Open the main `marvel-fed-challenge-2020-master` folder, nagivate into the `marvel-challenge` folder inside that, then into the `src` folder, and finally a folder named `hidden`. Once inside `hidden`, open the file named `api-key.js`.
6. Sign up on [developers.giphy.com](https://developers.giphy.com/) and generate an API key, the replace `API_KEY_HERE` with the key that you generated on the site. Save and close `api-key.js`.
7. Navigate back to the `marvel-challenge` folder in your terminal and run the command `npm start`.



## Initial Design
The initial design was done in Figma. Since starting development, the two designs have diverged but for any who want to see the original plan, open [the link here](https://www.figma.com/file/e2e4DHAFIPeIdRdD2yXnjV/Marvel-FED-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1).
